# PokeDaddy

An open-source iOS app for minimalist smartphone use with server-controlled app restrictions. PokeDaddy helps users reduce smartphone distractions by using Poke to disable apps 

Built for the Poke hackathon by Kevin Fang and Olsen Budanur.

## UI Design (2025 refresh)

- Introduced a lightweight design system in `pokedaddy/PokeDaddy/DesignSystem.swift` implementing a modern “digital glass” aesthetic.
- App-wide gradient background and frosted surfaces; no functional changes.
- New brand colors via asset catalog: `BrandStart`, `BrandEnd`, `BrandAccent`.
- Refined login and profile tiles with glass cards and gradient strokes.
- Added a new minimalist 1024×1024 app icon in `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/PokeDaddy1024.png` and wired it in `Contents.json`.
